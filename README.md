# SmithStanley's NutScript `WIG`!
`W`eapon `I`tem `G`enerator!

This is a simple item maker for weapons in  **NutScript Framework**...


# How To Use

This is a very simple addon which you should use when in `Single Player` for the most easiest use. 

Download the file from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/SmithyStanley/NutScript-Easy-Item-Maker/releases) and place it within your `garrysmod/lua/autorun/client/` directory

Join a single player level in your client

Give yourself the weapon you wish to make an item for, then type in `ns_generateWeaponFile` in console

Go into your `garrysmod/data` and feast your eyes on that new weapon file u have :) just rename the extension from `.txt` to `.lua` or use a `batch operation` to do it in bulk :)
